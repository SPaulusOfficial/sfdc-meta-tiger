In VisualCode using the terminal <br />
<strong>"dotNet run"</strong> command The following question will appear:<br />
<strong>"Please enter the path of the Package.xml path"</strong><br />
Enter the directory where your package.xml is located | Example: C:\Documents\workspace\DEV05\package.xml<br />
<strong>"Please enter the path of the repository where the files are:"</strong><br />
Enter your directory path, where the files are located | C:\Documents\workspace\DEV05<br />
<br />
Result:<br />
At the end it will copy the files that are needed in the package.xml, with the appropriate folders already addressed.<br />
<br />
For now I'm adding a folder called package on drive C: / <br />
<br />
